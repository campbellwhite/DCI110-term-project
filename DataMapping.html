              <p class="card-text fs-5">GINI Index in a measure that captures income inequality in a population. Thus, in the above visualization, the disparity in income can be examined at the county level. Higher GINI indices appear to be concentrated to an extent in the southern half of the country, with lower indices existing in more northern states. This seems to indicate that unequal wealth distribtuion is more extreme in the south, whcih could be due to several other confounding factors. This focal variable provides a complex starting point that generates many questions as to why income inequality seems to display this spatial pattern, some of which are subsequently explored.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">Depicted in the above visualization, violent crime rate is mapped onto counties. There seems to be a divide between the northern and southern half of the country, with northern counties appearing to have lower violent crime rates and southern ones exhbiting higher rates. It seems plausible that the counties with very high violent crime rates are likely to be more urban areas, where more people live and more law enforcement are likely to be active. However, it is important to keep in mind the differences that exist in crime reporting and potentially biased overpolicing of certain areas.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">PCP rate offers a decent idea of the availability of health care at the county level. Preliminarily, counties with higher PCP rates appear to be in the northern half of the country, specifically in the midwest region. Counties in the southern half seem to exhibit lower PCP rates, perhaps due to a higher proportion of rural localities that typically have fewer options for resources in general. This focal variable becomes especially interesting when examined in combination with percent of drinking adults.</p>

Some northern mid-western counties seem to have higher consumption rates, as well as occassional counties out further west. The southeast appears to have lower percentagess of drinking adults.

              <p class="reflection p-3 fs-5 mb-0">This was one of my first exposures to data science and R in general. I utilized some data wrangling techniques that enabled me to transform the numeric values of the focal variables into ordinal categories of values to represent ranging from very low to very high for each data set. Further, I used R's ggplot to construct the spatial visualizations to examine how these focal variables may be similar or different geographically across counties.</p>
              <p class="reflection fs-5 p-3">While only a preliminary analysis, this exploration raised questions about how unequal wealth distribution can be confounding factor at play affecting each of the subsequent focal variables explored. Income and SES enables and constrains the areas in which one lives, access to health care, the resources that one has available to them most generally. Observing how these population characteristics could be portrayed spatially taught me how important it is for the data with which I am working must not only make sense to me, but must also be intelligible to others who are only studying the visualizations.</p>
