                  <p class="card-text fs-5">This is anetwork diagram of the business relationships in the fictional world. From such visualizations, network types and overall structure can be discerned. This network is quite dense and transitive. This nodes are colored according to whether or not they have lost someone they care about at the hands of a superhero. The premise of this series is humans who have been wronged by superheroes conspiring to bring them down; thus, it is expected that this attribute of the characters would influence the structure of relationships. It does appear to do so; the people who have lost someone because of a superhero seem to cluster together to some extent, and the superheroes themselves, not having lost someone, seem to also band together.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">Community detection algorithms provide network analysts with various ways in which network clustering and groups can be divided. The algoritms determine the nest fitting groups within the network, and by numbering the nodes with a certain nodal attribute it is possible to see how well the algorithms clustered similar nodes. This diagram has the three shaded clusters found by the two best fitting algorithms, as well as nodes that are numbered according to whther or not they have lost a loved one because of a superhero. It is clear how the algorithms created clusters comprised of mostly similar nodes; a 1 denotes a character who has not lost someone and a 2 denotes a character who has. These algirthms are useful in visualizing and determine how clustered or lack thereof a network is.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">This is the output of an Exponential Random Graph model. These can be used to predict tie formation in a network in hopes of generating the actual network structure based on various model specifications that reflect tie-generative social processes. I include a number of nodal-level predictors, like gender and race, as well as dyadic-level predictors, such as if a pair of connected nodes shares the same attitudes towards suoerheroes or not. Thirdly, it is important to include a structural term in the model to see if processes like triadic closure are occurring between three nodes more than what would be expected by chance. All of these predictors work to simulate the actual structure that can be observed in network diagram. In this case, not many of the predictors used were signifcant in predicting tie formation, except for attitudes about superheroes, gender, and triadic closure.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">Above are the various iterations of the network that were generated by a sequence of ERGMs that I specified. The first one is completely random with edges placed between nodes totally by chance. The second diagram is the network that was generated by the most specified ERGM. The third diagram is the actual network diagram of the business ties in this fictional world. Clearly, the best specified ERGM is not all that similar looking to the real network. Thus, my ERGM is not a great representation of the influences of tie formation in this network. However, there is certainly a change in structure from the first to the second so identifying better predictors would most likely  improve the ERGM.</p>

                <p class="reflection p-3 fs-5 mb-0">This project highlighted above was my first exposure to network analysis and was exceptionally rewarding. A major focus of the course was examining how social capital is created within social networks and how this social capital is then diffused throughout the network. Network strucutre can be quite iluminating in how it allows us to see pathways through which information may or may not flow. Many advantages stem from being well-connected, however, nodes located proximate to other networks also benefit from different forms of social capital. The elements exhibited above help to determine influential members of networks who weild power because of the social capital they glean fom their network positions.</p>
                <p class="reflection fs-5 p-3">Perhaps the biggest theme of studying network analysis was distinguishing between how individuals are affected by their network postion at the individual level compared to determining how nodes at the individual level aggregate to form the overall network structure. Thanks to tools like ERGMs, as discussed above, such tie-generative social processes can be modelled to see if they are influencing or predictive of tie formation in a network. A comprehensive exploration of a social network can be produced using  all of these network analysis tools in hopes of determining who has influence in a network and how it is structurally possible, as well as why a network has the structure that it does.</p>
