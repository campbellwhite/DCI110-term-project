              <p class="card-text fs-5">This visualization is a scatterplot fitted with the lines of best fit. At the cutoff point, there appears to be a discontinuity in the measure of high school completionm at the 60% poverty threshold. This cutoff point reflects the level of poverty at which a county is eligble to receive assistance in applying for a Head Start program. Head Start is a program that aims to improve school performance in deeply impoverished areas, and only certain counties that apply will be chosen to have a program. With regression discontinuity, this cutoff point, referred to as a running variable, is established to examine if there is an effect of treatment after it has been administered. This plot serves as preliminary evidence that a discontinuity in high school completion does exist.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">RD analysis of the effect of treatment on high school completion indicates that receiving help applying for a Head Start program does affect high school completion. RD_model_3 generates a treatment effect of 0.043 (0.008 , 0.092). While this estimate of a local effect is pretty small, we can be certain that there is in fact an effect of treatment on this outcome because the confidence interval does not include zero.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title fs-2">Regression Discontinuity Analysis</h5>
              <p class="card-text fs-5"> The RD plot above shows that before the cutoff, high school completion is decreasing as poverty rate increases; then after the treatment threshold, the intercept for counties above the cutoff is higher and discontinuous from the below treatment counties. Thus, after treatment, high school completion appears to increase initially. This makes sense; if we assume that receiving assistance applying for HS will increase the probability of a HS program actually being instituted in a county, then this will have an effect on high school completion because some of their services seek to improve student performance.</p>

                <p class="reflection p-3 fs-5 mb-0">I learned about regression discontinutity in my Data Science Tools for Social Policy course. Using a variety of methods based on regression, treatment effects were the central focus of this course to help discern effective social policy. Regression discontinuity was especially interesting to me because of how it is both reflected in a model, as well as in visualizations.</p>
                <p class="reflection fs-5 p-3">In the RD plots, a discontinuity in the line of best fit can be seen, indicative that there is a difference in high school completion in counties that did and did not receive assistance in applying for a HS program. Further, this is reinforced by the estimate of the treatment effect in the RD model that was generated. This project helped to reaffirm the importance of having sound mathematical evidence in analyses, while simultaneously presenting them in clear and intelligible ways to an audience of varying exposure to such methods.</p>
