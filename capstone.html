I hypothesized that those who identify as feminist would participate more than non-feminists and secondly, that the relationship between a feminist identity and politcal participaton was mediated by the degree to which an individual believes that gender inequality exists. Using theoretical modelling and hypothesis testing with OLS and logistic regressions, I found that those who identify as feminist are more poltically active, but that this relationship is not in fact mediated by degree of belief. </h4>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">The diagram to the left reflects the theoretical model with which I arrived at my two hypotheses. Through my research, I found evidence that belonging to group or collective identity, like a feminist self-identity, works to socialize individuals to participate in greater rates. In a time when identity politics are quite prevalent, I believe that determining what exactly is driving people to participate, beyond just the self-identity or label, is very important. Thus, I theorized that perhaps this socialization works through changes in the dgeree to which one believes that gender inequality exists in the U.S. today such that those who identify as feminist are socialized to have a higher degree of belief compared to non-femininsts. Therefore, I predicted that the degree to which one believes in the existence of inequality mediates the relationship between a feminist self-identity and political participation.</p>

                <p class="reflection p-3 fs-5 mb-0">My mindset about data science overall completely shifted after my experience in SOAN 222, Data Science Tools for Social Policy. In this course, I was able to further my ability to apply data science techniques to real world social phenomena generally, but specifically regarding social policy questions. Regression discontinuity was just one skill we learned. The main focus was to learn statistical methods to examine causality and perform causal inference in relation to social policy decisions. I was introduced to the potential outcomes framework and the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to examine what it means to say that one social factor is a causal mechanism of another and how my assumptions of social influences are reflected in such graphs. I developed a much deeper understanding of regression analysis that incorporated multivariate analyses and the inclusion of interaction terms in regressions. This study of regression was essential to my learning of different techniques used to study causality and causal inference. </p>
                <p class="reflection fs-5 p-3">I first learned how to use instrumental variables to estimate a treatment effect when a focal x variable is not randomly assigned. Secondly, I learned the technique of difference-in-differences and used two-way fixed effects to perform causal inference while controlling for the influence of unit-invariant, time varying social factors, as well as time-invariant, unit-varying factors. Thirdly, we covered regression discontinuity, as discussed above. Overall, this course expanded my understanding of regression analysis, taught me how complex determining causality truly is, and reinforced the importance of presenting results in clear and intelligible ways so readers of various exposure to such techniques can understand the social policy implications of the analyses.</p>
