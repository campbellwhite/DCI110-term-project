This network is very dense and transitive, indicating that many nodes have relationships with many other nodes. Some nodes are more central than others, such as Starlight, Maeve, Hughie, and Butcher.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">This is the same familial network as above, this type with the nodes representing if their are a superheor or human. This is useful when examining why the network is structured he way that it is; are relationships shaped by whether someone is super or not? These being familial ties makes the grouping of superheroes or of humans less extreme; typically, it is not possible to choose the people to which one is related.</p>

Compared to the last network (family), there does appear to be more gorupings of relationships shaped by attitudes towards superheroes. This is referred to as homophily, when nodes generate ties with other nodes who share similar charcateristics.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">This network of business ties reflects whether a node has lossed someone that they cared about at the hands of a superhero. The premise of this series is humans who have been wronged by superheroes conspiring to bring them down; thus, it is expected that this attribute of the characters would influence the structure of relationships. It does appear to do so; the people who have lost someone because of a superhero seem to cluster together to some extent, and the superheroes themselves, not having lost someone, seem to also band together.</p>

                <p class="reflection p-3 fs-5 mb-0">Included above is only the preliminary steps of network analysis to which I was exposed in my Exploring Social Networks course. Visualizations are the first tools which can be used to discern basic descriptive information about networks. In this course, we also studied actor prominence and measure of centralization of networks. These elemnets further help to deteriine the most influential members of a network, who also likely shape othe rnetowrk ties to some extent. These measures serve to try and elucidate how network structure impacts vertices at the individual level.</p>
                <p class="reflection fs-5 p-3">Another dimension of network analysis is trying to determine how nodes at the individual level aggregate to form a network structure. This is done using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), that try to create the actual network based on nodal attributes, dyadic level predictors, and local structural characteristics. ERGMs produce probabilities of tie formation conditional on the network elements listed previously. A good ERGM will produce simulated network models that very closely resemble the actual network.</p>
